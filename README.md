# Soccer-Robot
This is a project that we made as a team of 4 members to develop a robot that is automated and can reach a goal from it's starting position while avoiding obstacles in a specified pitch area. The microcontroller used in the robot is the ATMega328p and the software used to write the C program is Microchip Atmel Studio.
