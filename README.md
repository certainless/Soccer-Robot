# Soccer-Robot
This is a project that I made with my team to develop a robot that is automated and can reach a goal from it's starting position while avoiding obstacles in a specified pitch area. The microcontroller used in the robot is the ATMega328p and the software used to write the C program is Microchip Atmel Studio.
